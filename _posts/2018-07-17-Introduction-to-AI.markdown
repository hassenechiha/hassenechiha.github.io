# Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the concept of having machines “think like humans” — in other words, perform tasks like reasoning, planning, learning, and understanding language. While no one is expecting parity with human intelligence today or in the near future, AI has big implications in how we live our lives. The brains behind artificial intelligence is a technology called machine learning, which is designed to make our jobs easier and more productive.



# There are many AI categories like : ML (machine learning) which  is the core driver of AI. It’s the concept of having computers learn from data with minimal programming as well as  DL (deep learning) which is AI that uses complex algorithms to perform tasks in domains where it actually learns the domain with little or no human supervision. In essence, the machine learns how to learn.

# ML : contains two steps which are 

# -Feature extraction (SIFT, SURF, Harris, ....) 

# -Feature Classification (SVM, KNN, RTree, ANN, ....)

# ML and DL are classified into many categories some of them are :

# -supervised learning (classification, regression)

# -unsupervised learning (clustering)

# DL is considered better than the ML because we can always make the model we're working on better


## __languages et environment (bib)__

- anaconda for the creation of the environment
- python which is the programming language
- bunch of bibliotheques which are :
    - numpy (for mathematic functionnalities)
    - pandas (for data management)
	- opencv (for treating images)
	- scikit-learn (for machine learning)
	- tensor flow (for deep learning)
	- keras (which an api for deep learning)
	- jupyter notebook (for interactive coding)
	- matplotlib (for graphics, curves ect ...)
